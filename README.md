# final_project
#This program generates factoring, polynomial addition, and polynomial multiplication problems. The polynomials are randomly generated from degree 0 to degree 3 with coefficients ranging from -10 to 10. The program will ask if each type of problem is desired. If so, how many problems of that type are wanted from 0 to 5. It uses sympy as a third-party library.
