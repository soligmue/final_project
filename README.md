# final_project
#We are going to write a program that generates and displays algebra problems with the simplified solutions.
#We will use sympy.simplify as a third-party library.  The user will input which rules they want to use such as factoring, adding like terms, and exponential rules.
#The program will output an algebra problem using those rules and the simplified solution.
